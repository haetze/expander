Derivation of

NatStream(mu s)

Adding

  (NatStream0(z0) <=== z0 = mu s)

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (NatStream(x:s) ===> Nat(x) & NatStream(s))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

All x s:((x:s) = mu s0 ==> Nat(x)) & All x s:((x:s) = mu s0 ==> NatStream0(s))

The reducts have been simplified.

SIMPLIFYING the preceding formula (14 steps) leads to 

NatStream0(2:(3:mu s0))

Adding

  (NatStream0(z1) <=== z1 = (2:(3:mu s0)))

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (NatStream(x:s) ===> Nat(x) & NatStream(s))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

NatStream0(3:mu s0)

The reducts have been simplified.

Adding

  (NatStream0(z2) <=== z2 = (3:mu s0))

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (NatStream(x:s) ===> Nat(x) & NatStream(s))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

NatStream0(mu s0)

The reducts have been simplified.

NARROWING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

mu s0 = (3:mu s1) | mu s0 = (2:(3:mu s1)) | mu s0 = mu s

SIMPLIFYING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

True

Number of proof steps: 6
