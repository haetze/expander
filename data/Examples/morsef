-- morsef


Derivation of

morsef(morse) ~ morse

Adding

  (x ~0 y <=== x = y)
& (x ~0 y <=== y ~0 x)
& (x ~0 z <=== x ~0 y & y ~0 z)
& (z0 ~0 z1 <=== z0 = morsef(morse) & z1 = morse)

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (s ~ s' ===> 
   head(s) = head(s') & 
   (head(tail(s)) = head(tail(s')) & tail(tail(s)) ~ tail(tail(s'))))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

morsef(tail(morse)) ~0 zip(tail(morse),inv(tail(morse)))

The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the THEOREM

zip(s,inv(s)) = morsef(s)

at position [1] of the preceding formula leads to 

morsef(tail(morse)) ~0 morsef(tail(morse))

The reducts have been simplified.

NARROWING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

True

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.
