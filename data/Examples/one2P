0. Derivation of

(all(one)$[3,4])

All simplifications are admitted.
Equation removal is safe.

1. SIMPLIFYING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

(one(3)&one(4))

2. Adding

  (one0(z0) <=== z0 = 3 | z0 = 4)

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (one(st) ===> (two/\(b#one))$st)

at positions
[]
of the preceding formulas leads to 

(two(3)&one0(3)&two(4))

The reducts have been simplified.

3. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

(one0(3)&two(4))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

4. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

two(4)

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

5. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

two(3)

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

6. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

True

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
