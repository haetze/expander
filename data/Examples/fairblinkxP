Derivation of

G(F((=!x).head))$blink

Adding

  (G0(z0)$z1 <=== z0 = F((=!x).head) & z1 = blink)

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (G(P)$s ===> P(s) & G(P)$tail(s))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

F((=!x).head)$blink & G0(F((=!x).head))$(1:blink)

The reducts have been simplified.

Adding

  (G0(z2)$z3 <=== z2 = F((=!x).head) & z3 = (1:blink))

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (G(P)$s ===> P(s) & G(P)$tail(s))

at position [1] of the preceding formula leads to 

F((=!x).head)$blink & F((=!x).head)$(1:blink) & G0(F((=!x).head))$blink

The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the AXIOMS

  (G0(z2)$z3 <=== z2 = F((=!x).head) & z3 = (1:blink))
& (G0(z0)$z1 <=== z0 = F((=!x).head) & z1 = blink)

at position [2] of the preceding formula leads to 

F((=!x).head)$blink & F((=!x).head)$(1:blink)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

NARROWING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

!x = 0 & F((=0).head)$(1:blink) | F((=!x).head)$(1:blink)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

NARROWING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

F((=0).head)$blink & !x = 0 | F((=!x).head)$(1:blink)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

NARROWING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

F((=!x).head)$(1:blink) | !x = 0

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

NARROWING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

1 = !x | F((=!x).head)$blink | !x = 0
