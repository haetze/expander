Derivation of

NatStream(1:(2:(3:s)))

Adding

  (NatStream0(z0) <=== z0 = (1:(2:(3:!s))))

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (NatStream(x:s) ===> Nat(x) & NatStream(s))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

NatStream0(2:(3:!s))

The reducts have been simplified.

Adding

  (NatStream0(z1) <=== z1 = (2:(3:!s)))

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (NatStream(x:s) ===> Nat(x) & NatStream(s))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

NatStream0(3:!s)

The reducts have been simplified.

Adding

  (NatStream0(z2) <=== z2 = (3:!s))

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (NatStream(x:s) ===> Nat(x) & NatStream(s))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

NatStream0(!s)

The reducts have been simplified.

NARROWING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

!s = (3:!s) | !s = (2:(3:!s)) | !s = (1:(2:(3:!s)))

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.
