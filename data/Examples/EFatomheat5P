0. Derivation of

EF(atom(heat))$5

All axioms are admitted.
Equation removal is safe.

1. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

EF(rel(SEC,(SEC = 4 | SEC = 7)))$2 | EF(rel(SEC,(SEC = 4 | SEC = 7)))$3

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

2. Applying the theorem

  (EF(P)$st <=== P(st) | EX(EF(P))$st)

at positions
[1]
of the preceding formulas leads to 

EF(rel(SEC,(SEC = 4 | SEC = 7)))$2 | EF(rel(SEC,(SEC = 4 | SEC = 7)))$1 | 
EF(rel(SEC,(SEC = 4 | SEC = 7)))$6

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

3. Applying the theorem

  (EF(P)$st <=== P(st) | EX(EF(P))$st)

at positions
[2]
of the preceding formulas leads to 

EF(rel(SEC,(SEC = 4 | SEC = 7)))$2 | EF(rel(SEC,(SEC = 4 | SEC = 7)))$1 | 
EF(rel(SEC,(SEC = 4 | SEC = 7)))$7

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

4. Applying the theorem

  (EF(P)$st <=== P(st) | EX(EF(P))$st)

at positions
[2]
of the preceding formulas leads to 

True

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
