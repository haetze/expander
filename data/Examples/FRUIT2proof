Derivation of

All b c:
(    (b,c) = (kirsche,glas)
 ==>     p2(b,c)
       & p2(x,y)
     |   p3(b,c)
       & p3(x,y)
     |   p4(b,c)
       & p4(x,y)
     |   p5(b,c)
       & p5(x,y))

Simplifying (5 steps) the preceding tree leads to the summand

  p2(kirsche,glas)
& p2(x,y)

Narrowing (4 steps) at position [] of the preceding summand leads to the summand

  False
& p2(x0,y0)

Simplifying the preceding summand leads to new ones. The current summand is given by

  p3(kirsche,glas)
& p3(x,y)

Narrowing (4 steps) at position [] of the preceding summand leads to the summand

  True
& p3(x1,y1)

Simplifying the preceding summand leads to the summand

p3(x1,y1)

Narrowing (6 steps) at position [] of the summand

  p4(kirsche,glas)
& p4(x,y)

leads to the summand

  p4(kirsche,glas)
& p4(x,y)

Simplifying the summand

p3(x1,y1)

leads to the summand

p3(x1,y1)

Narrowing at position [] of the summand

  p5(kirsche,glas)
& p5(x,y)

leads to the summand

  p5(kirsche,glas)
& p5(x,y)

Simplifying the preceding summand leads to new ones. The current summand is given by

p3(x1,y1)

Adding the other summands leads to

  p3(x1,y1)
| p4(x2,y2)
