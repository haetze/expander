0. Derivation of

Nat(x) ==> even(x) | odd(x)

All simplifications are admitted.
Equation removal is safe.

1. Adding

  (Nat0(x) ===> even(x) | odd(x))

to the axioms and applying FIXPOINT INDUCTION wrt

  Nat(0)
& (Nat(suc(x)) <=== Nat(x))

at positions
[]
of the preceding formulas leads to 

All x:(even(0) | odd(0)) & All x:(even(suc(x)) | odd(suc(x)) <=== Nat0(x))

2. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

All x:(True | odd(0)) & All x:(even(suc(x)) | odd(suc(x)) <=== Nat0(x))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
THIS GOAL COINCIDES WITH GOAL NO. 2

3. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

All x:(True | odd(0)) & All x:(odd(x) | odd(suc(x)) <=== Nat0(x))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.

4. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

All x:(True | odd(0)) & All x:(odd(x) | even(x) <=== Nat0(x))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.

5. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

All x:(True | odd(0)) & All x:(odd(x) | even(x) <=== even(x) | odd(x))

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.

6. SIMPLIFYING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

True
