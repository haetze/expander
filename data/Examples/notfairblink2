-- notfairblink2


Derivation of

not(G(F((=2).head)))$blink

SIMPLIFYING the preceding formula (3 steps) leads to 

F(G((=/=2).head))$blink

NARROWING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

G((=/=2).head)$blink | F(G((=/=2).head))$(1:blink)

The reducts have been simplified.

REMOVING SUBTREES at position [1] of the preceding formula leads to 

G((=/=2).head)$blink

The reducts have been simplified.

Adding

  (G0(z0)$z1 <=== z0 = ((=/=2).head) & z1 = blink)

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (G(P)$s ===> P(s) & G(P)$tail(s))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

G0((=/=2).head)$(1:blink)

The reducts have been simplified.

Adding

  (G0(z2)$z3 <=== z2 = ((=/=2).head) & z3 = (1:blink))

to the axioms and applying COINDUCTION wrt

  (G(P)$s ===> P(s) & G(P)$tail(s))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

G0((=/=2).head)$blink

The reducts have been simplified.

NARROWING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

True

The reducts have been simplified.
