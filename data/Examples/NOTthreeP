-- NOTthreeP


Derivation of

all(NOTthree)[1,3]

Simplifying the preceding formula (3 steps) leads to 

NOTthree(1) & NOTthree(3)

Adding

  (NOTthree0(z0) <=== z0 = 1 | z0 = 3)
& (three0(z0) ===> z0 =/= 1 & z0 =/= 3)

to the axioms and applying coinduction w.r.t.

  (NOTthree(st) ===> (a<>(not(atom(A))/\NOTthree))(st))

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

(a<>(not(atom(A))/\NOTthree0))(1) & (a<>(not(atom(A))/\NOTthree0))(3)

The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula (4 steps) leads to 

True

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.
