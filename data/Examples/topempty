-- TOPEMPTY


Derivation of

top(empty) = nothing

Applying the axioms

  nothing = index(0)
& empty = (new,0)

at positions [],[] of the preceding formula leads to the formula

top((new,0)) = index(0)

Simplifying the preceding formula leads to the formula

top(new,0) = index(0)

Narrowing the preceding formula leads to the formula

get(new,0) = index(0)

Narrowing the preceding formula leads to the formula

index(0) = index(0)

Simplifying the preceding formula leads to the formula
