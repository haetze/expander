0. Derivation of

((three(st)&(st`in`states))==>((st=2)|(st=4)))

All simplifications are admitted.
Equation removal is safe.

1. SHIFTING SUBFORMULAS at positions
[0,1]
of the preceding formulas leads to 

(three(st)==>((st`in`states)==>((st=2)|(st=4))))

2. Adding

  (three0(st) ===> (st `in` states ==> st = 2 | st = 4))

to the axioms and applying FIXPOINT INDUCTION wrt

  (three(st) <=== (a#(A\/three))$st)

at positions
[]
of the preceding formulas leads to 

(three0(1)==>False)

The reducts have been simplified.

3. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

True

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.
