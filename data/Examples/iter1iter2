-- iter1iter2


Derivation of

iter1(f,n) ~ iter2(f,n)

Applying the THEOREM

s = (map(loop(f)$0)$s)

at position [1] of the preceding formula leads to 

Any f0:(iter1(f,n) ~ (map(loop(f0)$0)$iter2(f,n)))

Applying the THEOREM

(map(loop(f)$n)$iter2(f,x)) = iter1(f,(loop(f)$n)$x)

at position [0,1] of the preceding formula leads to 

Any f0:(iter1(f,n) ~ iter1(f,(loop(f)$0)$n))

SIMPLIFYING the preceding formula (2 steps) leads to 

iter1(f,n) ~ iter1(f,n)

Applying the THEOREM

s ~ s

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

True

Number of proof steps: 4
