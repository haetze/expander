-- evensmorse


Derivation of

evens(morse) ~ morse

NARROWING the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

evens(zip(tail(morse),inv(tail(morse)))) ~ tail(morse)

The axioms were MATCHED against their redices.
The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the THEOREM

evens(zip(s,s')) = s

at position [0] of the preceding formula leads to 

tail(morse) ~ tail(morse)

The reducts have been simplified.

Applying the THEOREM

s ~ s

at position [] of the preceding formula leads to 

True

The reducts have been simplified.
