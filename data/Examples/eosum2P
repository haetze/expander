0. Derivation of

betaEO(st) = betaBeh(h(st))

All simplifications are admitted.
Equation removal is safe.

1. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

1 = betaBeh(h(esum)) & st = esum | 0 = betaBeh(h(osum)) & st = osum

2. SIMPLIFYING the preceding formulas (2 steps) leads to 

1 = (h(esum)[]) & st = esum | 0 = (h(osum)[]) & st = osum

3. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

1 = 1 & st = esum | 0 = (h(osum)[]) & st = osum

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.

4. SIMPLIFYING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

st = esum | 0 = (h(osum)[]) & st = osum

5. NARROWING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

st = esum | 0 = 0 & st = osum

The axioms have been MATCHED against their redices.

6. SIMPLIFYING the preceding formulas (one step) leads to 

st = esum | st = osum

7. Applying the theorem

st = esum | st = osum
