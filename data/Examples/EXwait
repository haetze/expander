-- EXwait


Derivation of

Idle(x)(xs,ys) & length(xs) < maxwait ==> EX(Wait(x))(xs,ys)

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

x `NOTin` xs & x `NOTin` ys & length(xs) < maxwait ==> 
Any st':((xs,ys) -> st' & Wait(x)$st')

The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

x `NOTin` xs & x `NOTin` ys & length(xs) < maxwait ==> 
Any f:(enabled(f)(xs,ys) & Wait(x)$f(xs,ys))

The reducts have been simplified.

Narrowing the preceding formula (1 step) leads to 

True

The reducts have been simplified.
